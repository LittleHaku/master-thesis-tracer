\chapter{User Profile Structure and Generation}\label{chapter:user_profiles}

Once the model has been finished,
we use it to automatically generate user profiles for SENSEI.
These serve as test cases designed to verify
the discovered functionalities of the chatbot,
its handling of different inputs,
to check if the outputs match the expected value,
and to find other errors such as timeouts.

First, \autoref{sec:profile-structure}
will cover the structure of these profiles and how they work,
then \autoref{sec:profile-generation}
will cover how these profiles are generated from the infered model.

\chapter{TRACER: Automated Chatbot Exploration}\label{chapter:tracer}

In this chapter we presnet \ac{TRACER},
a tool that tries to fill the gaps that we have seen
during our State of the Art \autoref{sec:sota} review.
This tool's purpose is to address the black-box testing challenge mentioned
by iteratively discovering functionalities
to create a structured model.

The chapter will be structured with first
a high-level overview of the tool's two phase implementation \autoref{sec:overview}.
Then we will detail the exploration phase \autoref{sec:exploration},
followed by the refinement phase \autoref{sec:refinement}.

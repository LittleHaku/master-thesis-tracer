\chapter{Tool Support}\label{chapter:tool_support}

To ensure that the proposed methodology can be reproduced,
we have implemented \acf{TRACER} in an open-source Python package
to allow users to execute it from a \ac{CLI}.
In addition, we have developed a web application
that allows users to execute both \ac{TRACER} and SENSEI
without requiring knowledge of how to operate the command line.

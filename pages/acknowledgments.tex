First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude
to my supervisors, Juan de Lara and Esther Guerra,
for their constant guidance, detailed feedback, and support.
Their experience and expertise were essential
in shaping the direction of this thesis.

I would also like to extend my thanks to the members of
the Modelling \& Software Engineering Research Group (MISO).
A special thanks is due to Alejandro del Pozzo,
whose work on the SENSEI user simulator
sparked the idea of creating TRACER.

On a more personal note,
I would like to thank my friends and family,
who have always supported me, even when I would refuse to go somewhere to focus on
adding features to TRACER, tweaking the webpage, or writing this thesis.
